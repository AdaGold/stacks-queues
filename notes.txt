A company has a stack of max six programmers

People change each intervals.

The company has a queue of programmers on a waiting list

When we initialize the program, the first five people on the queue will be dequeued and pushed onto the stack

At the end of an interval, a random number will be generated between 1 and 6
That many people will be popped off the stack and be enqueued back on the waiting list

if the dice roll is X
  pop X people off stack and enqueue them to the waiting list
  ^ do this step with a loop?
  dequeue X people from waiting list and push to stack

class Company
  # queue in here somewhere
  # stack in here somewhere
  def time_passed
  end
end
